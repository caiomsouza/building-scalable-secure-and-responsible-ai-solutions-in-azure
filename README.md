# Building Scalable, Secure and Responsible AI Solutions in Azure

Organizations are evolving and are becoming AI driven organisations. 

This repo aims to help Data Science teams to build Scalable, Secure and Responsible AI Solutions in Azure.

The AI journey can be devied into 2 parts:
1. Experimentation 
2. Production

Most of the companies are in the experimentation phase, but some are in the production phase. 

For the companies in the Production phase it is important to invest time to understand important topics like:
* AI/ML Platform
* MLOps
* Responsible AI
* AI/ML Security 

Here are some links to help your Data Science team:
